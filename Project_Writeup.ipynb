    "### Term 1 Project 3 : Behavioral Cloning\n",
    "#### Project Writeup\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Behavioral Cloning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior\n",
    "* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images\n",
    "* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set\n",
    "* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road\n",
    "* Summarize the results with a written report\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Rubric Points\n",
    "Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py - Contains the script for the model, pre-processing and augmentation of data, training\n",
    "* drive.py - Used for driving the car in autonomous mode using the model generated by model.py\n",
    "* model.h5 - Contains a trained convolution neural network \n",
    "* video.mp4 - Autonomous run in the simulator for Track 1 based on the model generated by model.py\n",
    "* writeup_report.md - Contains project writeup\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "My model is based on the NVIDIA End-End Deep Learning for Autonomous Cars. I've tweaked the architecture to fit to my purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pictorial representation of the model can be seen below\n",
    "\n",
    "![Behavioral Cloning Model Architecture] (ModelArchitecture.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of several layers of Convolutional and Fully Connected layers.\n",
    "Here's my model architecture with the hyperparameters in each layer"
